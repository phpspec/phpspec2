Contributing
------------

__phpspec2__ is an open source, community-driven project. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to do this, but remember to follow these few simple rules:

- Make your feature addition or bug fix,
- __Always__ use the `develop` branch as the base for your changes (all new development happens here, the `master` branch is for releases & hotfixes only),
- __Important__: to prevent unintentional breaks in future, please add _specs_ for your changes (please look in the `spec/` folder for some examples),
- Commit your code, but do not mess with `CHANGES.md` file,
- __Remember__: when you create a Pull Request, always select the `develop` branch as the target, otherwise it will be closed.
